### Pushing Github Commits

Before we can proceed with pushing commits we have to understand the basic commands and titles we use on git.

1. Commit - committing is the process which records changes in the repository. Think of it as a snapshot of the current status of the project. Commits are done locally.
2. Push - pushing sends the recent commit history from your local repository up to GitHub. If you’re the only one working on a repository, pushing is fairly simple. If there are others accessing the repository, you may need to pull before you can push.
3. Pull - a pull grabs any changes from the GitHub repository and merges them into your local repository.
4. Sync - syncing is like pulling, but instead of connecting to your GitHub copy of the forked repo, it goes back to the original repository and brings in any changes. Once you’ve synced your repository, you need to push those changes back to your GitHub account.
