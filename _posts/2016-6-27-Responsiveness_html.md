Responsive web design helps the website look good on all devices ie. mobile,
desktop and tablets.
This can be achieved by using CSS and HTML to resize, hide, shrink, enlarge,
 or move the content to make it look good on any screen.

Responsive web design has become more important as the amount of mobile traffic
 now accounts on a very high percentage.

Responsive web design is broken down into three components,
 flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media.

 1. Flexible layouts:
    - Practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid,
    capable of resizing to any width.
    They are built using relative length units, most commonly percentages or
    em units. Which are used to declare a common grid.

 2. Flexible media:
    - Not preffered at times because At times the width of a browser viewport may
    be so small that even scaling the the layout proportionally will create
     columns that are too small to effectively display content.


 3. Media queries:
    - Media queries were built as an extension to media types commonly found
     when targeting and including styles.
    - They also provide ability to specify different styles for browser and
    device.
