### A basic introduction to OOP
 grouping of class,object and grouping of data

 *Objects and classes*
Languages that support object-oriented programming typically use inheritance for code reuse and extensibility in the form of either classes or prototypes. Those that use classes support two main concepts:

**Classes** - the definitions for the data format and available procedures for a given type or class of object; may also contain data and procedures (known as class methods) themselves. i.e. Classes contains the data members and member functions.
Objects - instances of classes.
